#  Smart Attendance System

### Smart Attendance system is built using face recognition. 


In this we have used the Haar Cascade algorithm for face detection and Local Binary Patterns Histograms (LBPH) algorithm for facial recognition. The system built automatically marks the attendance in the excel sheet on recognising the face of a student. Our goal is to use the best automated method for the process of taking attendance.


##  Skills üõ†
Python


## Algorithms üìù

- Haar Cascade Classifier-
It is a classifier in which Cascade function is trained with positive  and negative images.
Collect the HAAR features i.e the edge features, line features and  centre surrounded features.
The algorithm is going to be used in face detection and feature  extraction

- Local Binary Pattern Histogram-
Local Binary Pattern Histogram (LBPH) face recognizer is used for taking attendance of students. LBPH facial recognizer is a pre-trained facial recognition classifier. If enough data sets are available on the face that is needed to be identified, LBPH can perform facial recognition with high accuracy.



## Features üìã

Below are the important python codes which are the core of our implementation:

- Check camera.py: To check whether the face is getting detected properly. 
- Capture Image.py: This will capture the images of the person. 
- Train.py: Train the captured images and work on datasets. 
- Recognize.py: To recognize and mark attendance.
- automail.py: To send mail to a specific mail id.
- main.py: Main program file to run the program
